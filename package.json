  "description": "Consist Fit is a web app focused on one thing: helping users stay consistent with their workouts. Some workout apps can be overwhelming for people who casually go to the gym, or for people looking to get back into the gym. While many workout apps show you lots of statistics on your workouts and diet, Consit Fit takes the opposite approach and simply helps you track how often you go to the gym. Users just login once a day to report if they met their fitness goals for that day, and they can view how consistent they've been on a weekly or monthly timescale. Consist Fit is aimed at people trying to build a new gym habit, people trying to get back into the gym, or people that are into exercising on a more casual level.",
